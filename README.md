An [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives AI assistants full control over [webMethods Integration Server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/webmethods-integration/wm-integration-server/11.1.0) -- replacing webMethods Designer for most development and administration tasks.

Single ~4MB binary, no runtime dependencies, works with any remote IS instance via pure HTTP APIs.

Compatible with any MCP client: [IBM Bob](https://www.ibm.com/products/bob), [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

### Interactive setup wizards (prompts)

The AI can guide you step-by-step through setting up:

| Prompt | What it does |
|---|---|
| `setup_jdbc_connection` | Walks through JDBC connection + adapter service creation, browses tables/columns interactively |
| `setup_kafka_streaming` | Sets up Kafka connection alias + event specification |
| `setup_jms_connection` | Creates JNDI provider + JMS connection (guides JAR installation) |
| `setup_mqtt_connection` | Sets up MQTT connection + trigger subscription |
| `setup_sap_connection` | Configures SAP adapter connection |
| `setup_scheduled_task` | Schedules a service for execution |
| `setup_rest_api` | Exposes services via OpenAPI or imports an API spec |
| `setup_user_management` | Creates users, groups, ACLs |
| `setup_oauth` | Registers OAuth clients and scopes |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Via npx (no install needed)
npx @wm-mcp-server/cli

# Or install globally via npm
npm install -g @wm-mcp-server/cli

# Or from crates.io (requires Rust)
cargo install wm-mcp-server

# Or download a pre-built binary from Releases
# https://github.com/cpoder/wm-mcp-server/releases
```

Binaries available for: Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, Apple Silicon), Windows (x86_64).

### 2. Configure your MCP client

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webmethods-is": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wm-mcp-server/cli"],
      "env": {
        "WM_IS_URL": "http://your-is-host:5555",
        "WM_IS_USER": "Administrator",
        "WM_IS_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if installed globally / via cargo:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webmethods-is": {
      "command": "wm-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "WM_IS_URL": "http://your-is-host:5555",
        "WM_IS_USER": "Administrator",
        "WM_IS_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Multiple IS instances

Create a config file (e.g., `wm-instances.json`):

```json
{
  "instances": {
    "dev": { "url": "http://dev-host:5555", "user": "Administrator", "password": "manage" },
    "prod": { "url": "http://prod-host:5555", "user": "Administrator", "password": "secret", "timeout": 60 }
  },
  "default": "dev"
}
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webmethods-is": {
      "command": "wm-mcp-server",
      "env": { "WM_CONFIG": "/path/to/wm-instances.json" }
    }
  }
}
```

Every tool accepts an optional `instance` parameter. Use `list_instances` to see what's configured.

### 3. Use

**Natural language examples:**

> "Create a flow service that greets the user by name"

The AI creates the package, folders, service with full flow logic, and tests it.

> "Set up a JDBC connection to my SQL Server and create a Select service for the orders table"

The AI uses the `setup_jdbc_connection` prompt to walk you through credentials, then browses your database tables/columns interactively (like Designer) to build the adapter service.

> "Debug the helloWorld service step by step"

The AI starts a debug session, steps through each flow step, shows you the pipeline state at each breakpoint.

> "Install JcPublicTools from the package registry"

The AI searches packages.webmethods.io, downloads the package from GitHub, installs it into IS, and activates it.

> "Run the test suite for MyPackage and show me the results"

The AI executes the unit tests, waits for completion, and retrieves the JUnit report.

> "Create an MQTT connection to my Mosquitto broker and subscribe to sensor/temperature"

The AI creates the connection, enables it, verifies connectivity, and sets up a trigger.

## How it works

```
AI Assistant ──MCP (stdio/HTTP)──> wm-mcp-server (Rust) ──HTTP/JSON──> webMethods IS (port 5555)
                                          │
                                          └──HTTPS──> packages.webmethods.io (marketplace)
```

All operations use IS built-in HTTP services. No filesystem access needed for most operations (marketplace install requires local access to the IS packages directory).

Flow services are created via `wm.server.ns/putNode` which accepts the full flow tree as JSON -- the same `FlowElement` / `Values` serialization used internally by the IS runtime. The server includes 7 embedded RAG resources: comprehensive flow language documentation, 15 working putNode examples (including TRY/CATCH, LOOP, BRANCH, MAPINVOKE, transactions), adapter service configuration guides, an FSL language reference, and on-prem provisioning / database setup notes.

### Transport modes

- **stdio** (default): Standard MCP stdio transport, works with all MCP clients
- **HTTP**: `wm-mcp-server --http 8080` starts a Streamable HTTP server at `/mcp` for MCP gateways

### Allowed hosts (HTTP mode)

To block DNS rebinding attacks, the HTTP transport validates the inbound `Host`
header and accepts **loopback only** (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) by
default. Requests carrying any other `Host` get `403`.

If the server is reached under a real hostname, list it in `WM_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
(comma-separated). Entries are *added* to the loopback defaults:

```bash
WM_ALLOWED_HOSTS=mcp.example.com,mcp.example.com:8080
WM_ALLOWED_HOSTS='*'   # disables Host validation entirely -- not recommended
```

### Tool scoping

Set `WM_SCOPES` to restrict which tools are exposed (useful for MCP gateways):

```bash
WM_SCOPES=develop,monitor  # Only development and monitoring tools
WM_SCOPES=readonly          # Only read-only tools (list, get, status)
WM_SCOPES=fsl-develop       # Only the FSL generate/validate/deploy/test cycle
```

Available scopes: `admin`, `develop`, `fsl-develop`, `unit-test`, `deploy`, `adapters`, `messaging`, `monitor`, `network`, `readonly`.

`unit-test` runs test suites and drives service mocks (`test_run`, `test_check_status`, `test_text_report`, `test_junit_report`, `mock_*`) plus the read-only access needed around them (`node_get`, `node_list`, `fsl_extract`, `service_invoke`, `package_list`, `package_info`, and `package_reload` — mandatory before every run, since a suite added on disk is not picked up otherwise). It deliberately exposes **no namespace mutation** (`put_node`, `fsl_deploy`, `folder_create`, `node_delete`, `package_create`), so it can be handed to a CI agent that must not rewrite the code it tests.

`fsl-develop` is a narrow subset of `develop` scoped to the FSL workflow (`dsl_validate`, `fsl_deploy`, `fsl_extract`, `service_invoke`, `node_list`, `node_get`, `node_delete`, `folder_create`, `package_create`, `package_list`, `package_reload`, `package_info`) — use it to expose FSL generation without pulling in SAP, flat-file, doc-type generation, debugging, or unit-testing tools that `develop` also covers.

## Requirements

- webMethods Integration Server 11.x with HTTP access enabled
- IS admin credentials (Administrator or equivalent)
- For JMS: provider client JARs in `WmART/code/jars/static/` + IS restart
- For Kafka streaming: Kafka client JARs in `WmStreaming/code/jars/static/`
- For marketplace install: MCP server needs filesystem access to IS packages directory
